            <p>Andrea Bocca lives and works between Crema and Milan.
        Through sculpture and installation, Andrea Bocca focuses his artistic research on a comparison between the shapes of the space and the objects that surround him. His interest in architecture and design brings him to develop a narrative that turns the exhibition space into a story. The rural imaginary where he comes from, merges with a modernist and industrial landscape, from which he gets new sources of ideas. Artisanal and industrial processes become the structural signs of his practice.</p>
